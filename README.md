# react-basic-starter

Yes yes, another starter.. 😅

This one isn't intended to be production ready today, but it's got the latest experimental React release along with a decent PureScript dev experience.

A simple `make` will pull deps, build, and bundle. `make dev` will run a dev server watching the `output` folder. Use your PureScript IDE plugin or `make build` to build individual changes.
